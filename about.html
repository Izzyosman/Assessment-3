      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Izzy and I'm currently in the brightpaths
        program and I'm learning to become a developer Monday through Fridays.
        During my weekends, I love to spend time with my family and friends. My
        favorite thing to do is go to brunch with my friends and I also love
        going to the farmer's market. It's also very necessary that I get an
        iced coffee from one of the many coffee shops we have in Minneapolis. My
        main goal every weekend is to spend time outdoors since my weekdays are
        spent indoors learning how to code. Besides working and learning, I love
        to travel. In december, I want to go to Dubai. Anyway feel free to look
        through my page to get to know more about me.
